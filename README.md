## 2. Purpose of the project<a name="purpose-of-the-project"></a>

The application provides developers to use a number of pre made components for web application , by addition of a CDN link, and make them able to customize those
components with a wide variety of utility classes made available by the library.

## 3. Technologies Used<a name="technologies-used"></a>
* The technologies used (HTML, CSS and vanilla JS) are basic and come with little to no dependencies in form of libraries and imports.
* These can be heavily manipulated or customized to build components as per the wish, with almost every component build from scratch. 

## 4. Motivations behind the project<a name="motivations-behind-the-project"></a>

* This project was built as part of my learning of HTML and CSS in neogcamp 2022 . It also serves as proof of concept, as being in vanilla css and vanilla JS
* The motivation behind making TrishnaUI was to make static reusable components that can be used to develop a wide ariety of web applications that can serve a whole lot of purposes, while coming from a same continuity, or basic pattern.  
* It does not uses any additional CSS or JS libraries , dependencies (exception being font family and icons) and higher JS or CSS frameworks  and is made from scratch, for every component in the library.

## 5. Problems solved by the project<a name="problems-solved-by-the-project"></a>

* The project/component library aims to solves or tries to mitigate the problem of making components while developing a web application in a faster, simpler and easier way
* Giving developers chance in customizing looks of components with a wide array of utility class avialable at their expense.

## 6. Learning from the project<a name="learning-from-the-project"></a>

* While making the component library I learnt the basic and various intermediate and advanced concepts of HTML , CSS and JS 
* I also went through official documentation and practical use cases so they can best serve the purpose.

## 7. Challenges and future iterations<a name="challenges-and-future-iterations"></a>

* One of the biggest challenges was to have to integrate a large number of colors because of theme feature adn day/night , light/dark mode that modern websites offer to their users, that is still in progress.
* Customizaiton is still being planned so as to give developers the chance to being able to add their custom styles or modify existing ones to serve their needs.
* Increasing the number of components available in the library is a top priority task out of all.
